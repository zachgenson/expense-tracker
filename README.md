# expense-tracker

## Overview
This is a simple command-line **Expense Tracker** built in Python that allows users to log their daily expenses. The application:
- Collects data about the expense: date, amount, category, and description.
- Saves the expenses in a CSV file (`expenses.csv`).
- Supports adding new expenses through a simple terminal interface.

## Features
- **Log new expenses**: Add details such as the amount, category, and description.
- **Save expenses**: The data is stored in `expenses.csv` for later reference.
- **Simple interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## How It Works
1. Run the program using `python app.py`.
2. Choose an option to log an expense or exit the program.
3. When logging an expense, you'll be prompted to enter:
   - The amount spent
   - The category (e.g., food, transport)
   - A short description of the expense
4. The expense will be saved to `expenses.csv` with the current date.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Git (for version control)
- A terminal or command prompt to run the Python script
